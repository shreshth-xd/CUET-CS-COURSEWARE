# <h1>A complete set of notes for Networking</h1>
<br>
<p>In this subfolder of this courseware, I have tried to pile up all the concepts of Networking. You don't have to worry about whether the notes provided here are taken from a specific book or not, The notes 
provided here are made in such a way to visualise the concept through diagrams and make you revise all
of your concepts within a short span of time.</p>
<br>
<p>The content provided here is enough for CUET UG examinations, however, aspirants targeting CUET-PG,
NIMCET or CS related GATE examinations may also go through these notes to revise and brush up on their
fundamentals.</p>
<br>
<h1>So how do you access these notes?</h1>
<p>Even if you don't know how to use Github, you don't have to worry or explicitly go and learn about Git and Github, you can just simply click on the folder as per what you want to learn and then your notes will
get opened.</p>
