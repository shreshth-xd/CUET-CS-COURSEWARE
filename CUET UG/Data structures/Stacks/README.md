# <h1>Introducing Stacks as a data structure</h1>

<p>
After learning about the Data structures like, what are Data structures? How many types of them are there
actually? Ok, if there are a many of them, then on what basis do we classify them? Ok, even if we classify
them , why do all of them exists? What are their use cases? And so on.... , we shall finally leanr about
one of them namely Stacks.

introductory notes of Data structures, then I highly suggest you to go through those notes by

## <h2>Ok, so what are Stacks?</h2>
<p>Before moving straight onto the code implementation of Stacks, you should first know that
what Stacks are, how do they work, and what principles or techniques to store the data and also
that Stacks are implemented in Python using the Lists since we don't Stacks and Arrays is not a
built-in or explicit data structure in Python, both Arrays(or Linear lists) and Stacks are
implemented in Python using lists.</p>
