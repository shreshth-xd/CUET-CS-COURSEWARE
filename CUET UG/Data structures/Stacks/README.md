# <h1>Introducing Stacks as a data structure</h1>

<p>
After learning about the Data structures like, what are Data structures? How many types of them are there
actually? Ok, if there are a many of them, then on what basis do we classify them? Ok, even if we classify
them , why do all of them exists? What are their use cases? And so on.... , we shall finally leanr about
one of them namely Stacks.

## <h2>Ok, so what are Stacks?</h2>
<p>Before moving straight onto the code implementation of Stacks, you should first know that
what Stacks are, how do they work, and what principles or techniques to store the data and also
that Stacks are implemented in Python using the Lists since we don't Stacks and Arrays is not a
built-in or explicit data structure in Python, both Arrays(or Linear lists) and Stacks are
implemented in Python using lists.</p>

## <h2>Alright... So how do we actually insert and delete elements in a Stack?</h2>
<p>Before you actually see how the elements are inserted in a Stack , you should realise that
it's not necessary for Stacks to hold only integers or a single item of a specific data-type as
an element, you can even insert a whole set, a whole list or a whole dictionary to a Stack as
a single element, and each element in a Stack is called as item-node.</p>
