This project is a demonstration of one of the most usefull use cases of exception and file handling.
Although this project does utilises some libraries, processes and modules which are out of the scope
of the syllabus of CUET-UG and maybe even CUET-PG as well, but this project focuses on how exception
and files can be managed and utilised in some real world use cases.

We have used a JSON file in this project to store our data and regex expressions for password validation.
