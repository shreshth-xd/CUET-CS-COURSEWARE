This project is a demonstration of one of the most usefull use cases of exception and file handling.
Although this project does utilises some libraries, processes and modules which are out of the scope
of the syllabus of CUET-UG and maybe even CUET-PG as well, but this project focuses on how exception
and files can be managed and utilised in some real world use cases.

Apart from, exception and file handling, I have also made it sure that most of these file handling operations
take place in constant time of O(1), after going through the code of main script you can get an idea, how to 
actually implement or contruct O(1) solutions for some typical and major problems while solving DSA or 
building excellent projects.
